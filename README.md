# QuestGuard

**Privacy-preserving gaming platform on Zama FHEVM**

QuestGuard enables competitive gaming where player moves, strategies, and scores remain encrypted during gameplay. Built on Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine, the platform processes game logic over encrypted player inputs, revealing only final match results while keeping individual actions and strategies private.

## About QuestGuard

QuestGuard is a decentralized gaming platform that brings true privacy to competitive gameplay. Using Zama FHEVM, player actions are encrypted and processed homomorphically, ensuring opponents cannot see your moves or strategies until matches conclude. This creates a fair, private gaming environment where skill determines outcomes, not information advantage.

**Mission**: Enable competitive gaming with cryptographic privacy guarantees and verifiable fairness.

## The Gaming Privacy Challenge

### Current Gaming Models

**Transparent Blockchain Games:**
- All moves visible on-chain
- Strategies exposed to opponents
- Front-running possible
- Information asymmetry advantages

**Centralized Games:**
- Trust required in game servers
- No verifiable fairness
- Hidden manipulation possible
- Data privacy concerns

**QuestGuard Solution:**
- Moves encrypted during gameplay
- Strategies remain private
- Fair play cryptographically guaranteed
- Verifiable results without move exposure

---

## How QuestGuard Works

### Match Flow

**Pre-Match:**
1. Players connect wallets and join match lobby
2. FHE keys generated and distributed
3. Match parameters set (rules, duration, stakes)
4. Match contract deployed

**During Match:**
1. Players encrypt moves using FHE public keys
2. Encrypted moves submitted to smart contract
3. Game logic processes encrypted moves homomorphically
4. Game state updated over encrypted values
5. No plaintext moves visible to opponents or validators

**Post-Match:**
1. Match concludes after time limit or victory condition
2. Final game state decrypted (threshold keys)
3. Results published with cryptographic proofs
4. Winners determined and rewards distributed
5. Full match replay available (optional decryption)

### Privacy-Preserving Game Logic

**Move Validation:**
```solidity
ebool isValidMove = TFHE.and(
    TFHE.gt(encryptedMove, 0),
    TFHE.lt(encryptedMove, maxMoveValue)
);
```

**Score Calculation:**
```solidity
euint64 newScore = TFHE.add(playerScore, encryptedMoveValue);
```

**Win Condition:**
```solidity
ebool hasWon = TFHE.gte(newScore, winThreshold);
```

        uint256 endTime;
    }
    
    function submitMove(uint256 matchId, bytes calldata encryptedMove) external;
